# Lite Swiss Design

In this demo, you will be recreating the Swiss Design poster below, but in HTML and CSS. You have been provided with
an `index.html` file that contains the content of the poster. Use this as your starting point. With a partner, add CSS to
`assets/css/styles.css` to try to replicate the poster.
