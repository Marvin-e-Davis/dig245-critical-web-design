# Lite Swiss Design

In this demo, you will be recreating the Swiss Design poster below, using only HTML/CSS and text (no images).
You have been provided with an `index.html` file that contains the content of the poster. Use this as your starting
point. With a partner, add CSS to `assets/css/styles.css` to try to replicate the poster.

If you finish the first poster before the end of class, then try to do the same thing with any of the more challenging
posters in the image below.
