### HTML Terms

Term | Definition
--- | ---
[Element](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp) | The element includes the opening tag, content between, and the closing tag. (e.g. `<b>Content</b>`)
[Tag](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp) | The opening or closing part of an HTML element. Can be an opening, closing, or self-closing tag. (e.g. `<b>`)
[Attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp) | Provide additional information to HTML elements. Attributes are specified in the start tag and usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value". (e.g. `<a href="https://google.com">Google</a>` )
[Block-level](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp) | HTML elements have default `display` values depending the element type. A `block-level` element (e.g. `<div>`) always starts on a new line and takes up the full width of its parent element. `Inline elements` (e.g. `<span>`) do not start on a new line and only take as much width as necessary.
[Bookmarks](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp) | a.k.a. "targeted anchors" are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a Web page when clicked. (e.g. `<a href="#section2">Jump to section 2</a>`)
